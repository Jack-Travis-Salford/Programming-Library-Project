PROJECT TITLE: Library Project - Salford University Programming 2 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To Mimic a Library System that allows Users to Reserve Items. 
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: All actions should be done via the Library class
AUTHORS: Jack Travis, D E Newton (DateUtil, Diary)
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Create the directory \..\Text Files\ (starting from the file in which this text document is located). If this isn't created, the program will
create it itself when/if it is required. 





NOTE: All code submitted in this assignment is of my work, excluding DateUtil & Diary classes.

All my methods of the solutions in my program come from either/both of these sources:
1. PowerPoint presentations provided by D E Newton
2. Extensive searching of Java Documentation (docs.oracle.com)

In the case of being unsure how to approach a task (ie, I didn't know the exact methods to call), I made a seperate project, duly named Test, to test out
methods/ideas in a way which wouldn't damage the integrity of the submission with potentially useless code. 
Most testing, such as ensuring a unique ID is assigned to each user works under normal and extreme conditions, was done via the project Test (although 
ensuring successful implementation of said code into the Assignment was of course tested as well).  

The project Test, is a stand-alone project to the assignment, and as such has not been included in my submission (any code in Test which worked as I 
expected/wanted was implemented in the Library Project). However, if this is deemed at all necessary for marking purposes, said project can be 
provided, upon request (Note: As it had the sole purpose of testing, it may not contain comments to the same degree as this Project, potentially
making it harder to understand).

NOTE: Test project is different to Test class, which is submitted within the assignment
